                    <p>Welcome, not much to say for now, but take a look at my projects. For now here's a letter the comback kid wrote himself</p>

                    <p id="letter">"If you happen to be very lucky, when you are 10 years old, you will have people in your life tell you
                        that the world can be anything you want it to be, and you will believe them. And those same people
                        will never put limits on your abilities. So no matter the circumstances, you always try your best
                        and you never give up, because that’s what you do when you’re chasing your dream. <br><br>If you’re lucky,
                        you will have family, teammates, coaches, mentors and trainers along the way to help you when you
                        lose faith in yourself. And they will give you the strength to carry on. <br><br>If you’re lucky, you may
                        get picked last, you may ride the bench, and many times the team may move on without you, and you
                        come to recognize that, in return, you are given the chance to earn the greatest edge of all that
                        can never be taken away: WILL. HEART. To anyone who feels left out or is afraid of trying their best
                        for fear of failure, you are not alone. The magic you’re looking for is in the WILL of trying and
                        not giving up. The love of your dream is in your HEART. <br><br>One day, you will look back on your life
                        and appreciate the struggle and have nothing but gratitude for everything that happened along the
                        way. To anyone who is struggling early in the morning or late at night in pursuit of your dream,
                        struggles that many will never see, and to any leaders out there who believe in someone who doesn’t
                        yet believe in themselves… Keep going. Keep going. Because WILL always finds a way." - Tom Brady
